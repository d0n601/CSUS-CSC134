CSC 134 Assignment 4


Notes: 

I completed this assignment using my own mysql installation. So here are some additional steps taken to get going. I do not include the installation process because I've had it installed for quite some time.


First, logging into the mysql consile via the following command (Debian Linux Terminal),

mysql -u root -p ********


In order to create the schema, I issued the following command.

CREATE SCHEMA PAINT_STORE CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;


After that, in order to issue commands on the PAINT_STORE schema, I issued,

use PAINT_STORE;



The rest of the statements to complete the assignment can be found in their respective text files.
